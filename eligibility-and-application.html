        <h1>Eligibility and Application for the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme</h1>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Understanding AFCS Eligibility</h2>
            <p>The Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS) is designed to provide compensation to service personnel and veterans who have suffered injuries or illnesses as a result of their service in the UK Armed Forces. Understanding the eligibility criteria is crucial for a successful application.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Service Requirements</h2>
            <p>To be eligible for the AFCS, you must have been a serving member of the UK Armed Forces at the time of the incident that caused your injury or illness. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Regular forces</li>
                <li>Reserve forces</li>
                <li>Royal Fleet Auxiliary</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It's important to note that the scheme covers injuries or illnesses that occurred on or after 6 April 2005. For incidents before this date, you may be eligible under the War Pension Scheme.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Medical Fitness</h2>
            <p>The AFCS considers the impact of your injury or illness on your ability to perform your duties and your overall quality of life. Key points to consider include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The injury or illness must be caused by service</li>
                <li>Pre-existing conditions may be considered if they were made worse by service</li>
                <li>Mental health conditions are also covered under the scheme</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A thorough medical assessment is a crucial part of the application process. Our team can help you gather the necessary medical evidence to support your claim.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Application Deadlines</h2>
            <p>Understanding the time limits for AFCS applications is crucial:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You have 7 years from the date of injury or illness to make a claim</li>
                <li>For illnesses, the 7-year period starts from the date of diagnosis or the start of medical treatment</li>
                <li>In cases of late onset illness, you can claim at any time after leaving service</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It's important to act promptly, but don't worry if you're approaching the deadline. Our experts can help you expedite your application process.</p>
