        <p class="lead">If you disagree with a decision made about your Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS) claim, you have the right to appeal. This page outlines the appeal process, providing guidance on how to challenge a decision and what to expect at each stage.</p>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">Grounds for Appeal</h2>
        <p>You may appeal a decision if:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your claim was rejected and you believe it should have been accepted</li>
          <li>You disagree with the level of compensation awarded</li>
          <li>You believe an error was made in assessing your claim</li>
          <li>New evidence has come to light that wasn't available when the original decision was made</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">Stages of Appeal</h2>
        <p>The appeal process typically involves the following stages:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Internal Reconsideration</li>
          <li>Appeal to an Independent Tribunal</li>
          <li>Further Appeal on Point of Law</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">1. Internal Reconsideration</h2>
        <p>The first step in challenging a decision:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Request a reconsideration within 12 months of the original decision</li>
          <li>Provide reasons for disagreeing with the decision</li>
          <li>Submit any new evidence to support your case</li>
          <li>A different decision maker will review your case</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">2. Appeal to an Independent Tribunal</h2>
        <p>If you're not satisfied with the reconsideration:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal (War Pensions and Armed Forces Compensation)</li>
          <li>Submit your appeal within 12 months of receiving the reconsideration decision</li>
          <li>Prepare for a hearing where you can present your case</li>
          <li>You may bring representatives or witnesses to support your appeal</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">3. Further Appeal on Point of Law</h2>
        <p>If you believe the tribunal made a legal error:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Apply for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal</li>
          <li>This appeal must be based on a point of law, not just disagreement with the decision</li>
          <li>Seek legal advice, as these appeals can be complex</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">Preparing for an Appeal</h2>
        <p>To strengthen your appeal:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Gather all relevant medical evidence</li>
          <li>Seek statements from witnesses or experts if applicable</li>
          <li>Clearly articulate your reasons for appealing</li>
          <li>Consider seeking assistance from veterans' organisations or legal advisors</li>
        </ul>
