      <div class="col-lg-8">
        <p class="lead">The Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS) considers the impact of your injury or illness on your ability to perform your duties and your overall quality of life. This page outlines the key medical fitness criteria used to assess eligibility for compensation.</p>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">Service-Related Injuries and Illnesses</h2>
        <p>To be eligible for compensation under the AFCS, your injury or illness must be caused by service. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Physical injuries sustained during training or operations</li>
          <li>Mental health conditions related to service experiences</li>
          <li>Illnesses developed as a result of exposure to harmful substances or environments during service</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">Assessment of Severity</h2>
        <p>The scheme uses a tariff-based system to assess the severity of injuries and illnesses. Factors considered include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The nature and extent of the injury or illness</li>
          <li>The impact on your ability to work and daily life activities</li>
          <li>The long-term prognosis and potential for recovery</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">Pre-existing Conditions</h2>
        <p>Pre-existing conditions may be considered if they were made significantly worse by service. The assessment will focus on the degree of worsening attributable to service.</p>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">Mental Health Conditions</h2>
        <p>The AFCS recognises a range of mental health conditions, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</li>
          <li>Depression and anxiety disorders</li>
          <li>Adjustment disorders</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These conditions are assessed based on their severity and impact on daily functioning.</p>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">Medical Evidence</h2>
        <p>A thorough medical assessment is a crucial part of the application process. You may need to provide:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Medical records from service and civilian healthcare providers</li>
          <li>Specialist reports detailing your condition</li>
          <li>Evidence of ongoing treatment or rehabilitation</li>
        </ul>
