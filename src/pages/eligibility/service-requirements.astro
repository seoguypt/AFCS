    <div class="row g-4">
      <div class="col-lg-8">
        <p class="lead">To be eligible for the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS), you must meet specific service requirements. This page outlines the key criteria related to your service that determine your eligibility for compensation.</p>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">Qualifying Service</h2>
        <p>The AFCS covers injuries, illnesses, or deaths that are caused by service in the UK Armed Forces. Qualifying service includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Regular service in the Army, Royal Navy, or Royal Air Force</li>
          <li>Reserve Forces service, including training and mobilised service</li>
          <li>Royal Fleet Auxiliary service</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">Time of Service</h2>
        <p>The scheme applies to injuries or illnesses that occurred on or after 6 April 2005. For incidents before this date, you may be eligible under the War Pension Scheme.</p>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">Length of Service</h2>
        <p>There is no minimum length of service required to be eligible for the AFCS. Even a single day of service can qualify you if the injury or illness is service-related.</p>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">Special Circumstances</h2>
        <p>Some special service circumstances may affect eligibility:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reservists may be eligible for injuries sustained during training as well as active service</li>
          <li>Injuries sustained during selection or training processes may be covered</li>
          <li>Certain overseas postings or exchanges may have specific considerations</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">Time Limits for Claims</h2>
        <p>While not strictly a service requirement, it's important to note the time limits for making a claim:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You have 7 years from the date of injury or illness to make a claim</li>
          <li>For illnesses, the 7-year period starts from the date of diagnosis or the start of medical treatment</li>
          <li>There are exceptions for late-onset illnesses, where you can claim at any time after leaving service</li>
        </ul>
