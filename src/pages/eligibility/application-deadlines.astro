        <p class="lead">Understanding and adhering to application deadlines is crucial when claiming compensation through the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS). This page outlines the key time limits and provides guidance on ensuring your claim is submitted within the required timeframe.</p>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">Standard Time Limit</h2>
        <p>The standard time limit for making an AFCS claim is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>7 years from the date of injury or illness</li>
          <li>For illnesses, 7 years from the date of diagnosis or the start of medical treatment</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">Exceptions to the Standard Time Limit</h2>
        <p>There are several exceptions to the 7-year rule:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Claims for mental disorders can be made at any time</li>
          <li>Claims for late-onset illnesses can be made at any time after leaving service</li>
          <li>In exceptional circumstances, the time limit may be extended</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">Determining the Start Date</h2>
        <p>The start date for the 7-year period depends on the nature of your claim:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>For injuries: the date the injury occurred</li>
          <li>For illnesses: the date of diagnosis or when medical advice was first sought</li>
          <li>For worsening of existing conditions: the date the condition worsened due to service</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">Late Claims</h2>
        <p>If you're submitting a claim after the standard time limit:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide a detailed explanation for the delay</li>
          <li>Include any supporting evidence for why the claim couldn't be made earlier</li>
          <li>Be aware that late claims are considered on a case-by-case basis</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">Ensuring Timely Submission</h2>
        <p>To ensure your claim is submitted on time:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Start gathering necessary documentation as soon as possible</li>
          <li>Seek medical evidence promptly</li>
          <li>Consider seeking assistance from veterans' organisations or legal advisors</li>
          <li>Submit your claim well before the deadline to allow for any unforeseen delays</li>
        </ul>
