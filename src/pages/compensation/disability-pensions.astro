        <p class="lead">Disability pensions are a crucial component of the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS), providing ongoing financial support to those with service-related disabilities. This page explains the types of disability pensions available and how they are determined.</p>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">Guaranteed Income Payments (GIP)</h2>
        <p>Guaranteed Income Payments are regular, tax-free payments designed to compensate for loss of earning capacity. Key points include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Payments are made for more severe injuries or illnesses</li>
          <li>The amount is based on your salary, age, and the severity of your condition</li>
          <li>GIPs are payable for life and are index-linked to protect against inflation</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">Calculation of GIP</h2>
        <p>The calculation of a Guaranteed Income Payment takes into account:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your salary at the time of injury or illness</li>
          <li>Your age and potential career progression</li>
          <li>The severity of your condition, as determined by the AFCS tariff</li>
          <li>Any other income or pensions you may be receiving</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">Supplementary Allowances</h2>
        <p>In addition to the GIP, you may be eligible for supplementary allowances:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Constant Attendance Allowance for those needing daily care</li>
          <li>Mobility Supplement for those with severe physical disabilities</li>
          <li>Allowance for Lowered Standard of Occupation in certain cases</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">Reviews and Adjustments</h2>
        <p>Your disability pension may be subject to review:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If your condition significantly worsens, you can request a review</li>
          <li>Periodic reviews may be conducted to ensure your pension remains appropriate</li>
          <li>Any changes in your condition that improve your earning capacity may affect your payments</li>
        </ul>
