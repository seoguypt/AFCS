        <p class="lead">Lump sum payments are a key component of the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS), providing immediate financial support for service-related injuries or illnesses. This page explains how these payments work and how they are determined.</p>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">Purpose of Lump Sum Payments</h2>
        <p>Lump sum payments serve several purposes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Compensate for pain and suffering caused by the injury or illness</li>
          <li>Provide immediate financial support for adaptation to changed circumstances</li>
          <li>Recognise the impact of the injury or illness on quality of life</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">Tariff-Based System</h2>
        <p>The AFCS uses a tariff-based system to determine lump sum payments:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Injuries and illnesses are categorised into 15 tariff levels</li>
          <li>Each level corresponds to a specific lump sum amount</li>
          <li>The most severe injuries (level 1) receive the highest payments</li>
          <li>Payments range from a few thousand pounds to several hundred thousand pounds</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">Multiple Injuries</h2>
        <p>If you have multiple injuries from a single incident:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You'll receive 100% of the lump sum for the most severe injury</li>
          <li>30% of the tariff amount for the second most severe injury</li>
          <li>15% of the tariff amount for the third most severe injury</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">Tax-Free Status</h2>
        <p>All lump sum payments under the AFCS are tax-free, meaning you receive the full amount awarded.</p>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">Interim Payments</h2>
        <p>In some cases, interim payments may be available:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If your claim is likely to succeed but a final decision can't be made immediately</li>
          <li>To provide financial support while awaiting the full assessment</li>
        </ul>
