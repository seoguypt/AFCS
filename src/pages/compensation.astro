        <p class="lead">The Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS) offers various types of compensation to support service personnel and veterans who have suffered injuries or illnesses due to their service. Understanding these different types of compensation is crucial for ensuring you receive the full support you're entitled to.</p>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">Disability Pensions</h2>
        <p>Disability pensions are a key component of the AFCS, providing ongoing financial support to those with service-related disabilities. These include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Guaranteed Income Payments (GIP) for more severe injuries</li>
          <li>Supplementary payments for specific disabilities</li>
          <li>Payments based on the severity of the injury and its impact on earning capacity</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">Lump Sum Payments</h2>
        <p>For less severe injuries or illnesses, the AFCS provides lump sum payments. These are designed to compensate for pain and suffering and are tax-free. The amount depends on the nature and severity of the injury or illness.</p>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">Bereavement Benefits</h2>
        <p>The AFCS also provides support for families of service personnel who have died as a result of service. Bereavement benefits can include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Survivor's Guaranteed Income Payment (SGIP)</li>
          <li>Child's Payment for eligible dependent children</li>
          <li>Bereavement Grant to help with immediate costs</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">Additional Compensation Elements</h2>
        <p>The AFCS may also provide compensation for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Medical expenses related to the service-induced injury or illness</li>
          <li>Costs of ongoing medical treatment</li>
