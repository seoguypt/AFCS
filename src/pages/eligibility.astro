        <p class="lead">Understanding your eligibility for the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS) is the first step towards receiving the support and compensation you deserve. This page outlines the key criteria and considerations for AFCS eligibility.</p>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">Service Requirements</h2>
        <p>To be eligible for the AFCS, you must have been a serving member of the UK Armed Forces at the time of the incident that caused your injury or illness. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Regular forces</li>
          <li>Reserve forces</li>
          <li>Royal Fleet Auxiliary</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The scheme covers injuries or illnesses that occurred on or after 6 April 2005. For incidents before this date, you may be eligible under the War Pension Scheme.</p>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">Medical Conditions</h2>
        <p>The AFCS covers a wide range of injuries and illnesses, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Physical injuries sustained during service</li>
          <li>Mental health conditions related to service</li>
          <li>Illnesses developed as a result of service</li>
          <li>Pre-existing conditions worsened by service</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's important to note that the injury or illness must be caused by service or significantly worsened by it.</p>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">Time Limits</h2>
        <p>There are specific time limits for making an AFCS claim:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You have 7 years from the date of injury or illness to make a claim</li>
          <li>For illnesses, the 7-year period starts from the date of diagnosis or the start of medical treatment</li>
          <li>In cases of late-onset illness, you can claim at any time after leaving service</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While it's important to act promptly, don't be discouraged if you're approaching the deadline. Our experts can help you navigate the process efficiently.</p>
        
        <h2 class="h3 mt-4">Special Circumstances</h2>
        <p>There are some special circumstances that may affect eligibility:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Claims related to service before 6 April 2005 may be considered under the War Pension Scheme</li>
          <li>Reservists may be eligible for injuries sustained during training as well as active service</li>
          <li>In some cases, dependents or family members may be eligible for benefits if a service person has died due to service</li>
        </ul>
